**We prefer you to use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com)**

## Server

> You should be aware of below stacks(do not need to be professional) to contribute to server project.

1. [Graphql](https://graphql.org)
2. [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server)
3. [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)
   - AKA Prisma2
4. [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org)


## Client

> You should be aware of below stacks(do not need to be professional) to contribute to client project.

1. [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native)
   - [iOS / Android setup guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)
2. [react-native-unimodules](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules)
3. [Graphql](https://graphql.org)
4. [Relay](https://relay.dev)


## Installation

1. Fork our project to yours.
   - Recommended to have `forked` master branch to be updated to upstream.
   - Configure [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/).
     - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/dooboolab/hackatalk`
     - Check it with `git remote -v`
   - Fetch the branches from upstream repository by `git fetch upstream`
   - When you want to give `PR`, make new branch `git checkout -b [feature_name]`
     - Before pushing `PR`, do `git fetch upstream` from master branch then try the rebase by `git rebase master`
     - Check your status by `git log --decorate --oneline --all --graph` or `npm run git:log`
2. Git clone your forked repository.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-id>/hackatalk.git
   ```

#### Installation - Client specific

1. Install your packages in `client` directory.
   ```
   yarn
   ```
   - Note that we recommend using yarn because all of our team members do.
   - Also note that `yarn.lock` and `package-lock.json` sometimes make collision. Try to delete one of them.

2. Configure `environment` for project
   - Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`.
     ```
     cp .env.sample .env
     ```

3. Run your project
   - Server
     - Run `yarn dev` or `yarn local` if you want to run your local server.
   - Client
     - `ios`
       - yarn `ios`
     - `android`
       - yarn `android`
         > Note that you should open your emulator beforehand before running above command since the script won't automatically open emulator unlike `ios`.

4. Configure linting in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com) correctly.
   - Example vscode [setting.json](https://gist.github.com/hyochan/815e9040593180c4725d7694d863e5a1)


#### Installation - Server specific

1. Install your packages in `client` directory.
   ```
   yarn
   ```
   - Note that we recommend using yarn because all of our team members do.
   - Also note that `yarn.lock` and `package-lock.json` sometimes make collision. Try to delete one of them.

2. Configure [postgresql](https://www.google.com/search?q=postgresql&rlz=1C5CHFA_enKR865KR867&oq=postgresql&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j35i39j0l3j69i60j69i61l2.3220j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) database.

3. Setup environment
   1. cp `./prisma/.env.sample` `./prisma/.env`
   2. Include `DATABASE_URL`
      ```
      DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>!@<url>:5432/postgres?schema=<scheme>"
      ```
      > Note that you should change appropriate values in `user`, `password`, `url`, `scheme` fields. Or you can even use other database. More about [connection urls](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-connectors/connection-urls)
   3. Also configure change `dotenv` variables if you want to run locally
      - Copy `dotenv/.dev` to `dotenv/.env`.
        ```
        cp dotenv/.env.sample dotenv/.env
        ```
      - Then run `yarn local`
   4. Please include `test` user locally to test queries in your database.
      ```
      CREATE ROLE test WITH LOGIN NOSUPERUSER INHERIT CREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION PASSWORD 'test!';
      GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO test;
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE postgres TO test;
      // Inside `postgres` database create `test` schema.
      CREATE SCHEMA test;
      ```
      - Above should match `test.env`
        ```
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://test:test!@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=test"
        ```

4. Generate Prisma Client and Nexus
   ```
   yarn generate
   ```

5. Migration

   1. Change models in `schema.prisma`.
   2. Run migration script.
      ```
      yarn migrate:save
      ```
      > Prisma lift will generate migration file for you.
   3. Run migration.
      ```
      yarn migrate:up
      ```


### Commit message

Commit messages should include a title, summary, and test plan.

Write the title in the imperative mood and prefix it with a tag that describes the affected code, like [android] or [video], and makes it easier to read through the commit log.

In the summary, explain the motivation behind the commit ("why") and the approach it takes ("how"). Note things that aren't communicated by the code or require more context to infer.

Use the test plan to communicate how to verify the code actually works and to help others in the future create their test plans for the same area of the codebase.

This post called [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) has a lot of good guidance, too.

### Issue

- Please search and register if you already have the issue you want to create. If you have a similar issue, you can add additional comments.
- Please write a problem or suggestion in the issue. Never include more than one item in an issue.
- Please be as detailed and concise as possible. \* If necessary, please take a screenshot and upload an image.

### Pull request(PR)

PR is available to `master` branch.

Each PR should correspond to one idea and implement it coherently. This idea may be a feature that spans several parts of the codebase. For example, changing an API may include changes to the Android, iOS, and web implementations, the JavaScript SDK, and the docs for the API.

Generally, each PR should contain one commit that is amended as you address code review feedback. Each commit should be meaningful and make sense on its own. Similarly, it should be easy to revert each commit. This keeps the commit history easier to read when people are working on this code or searching for a commit that could have broken something.

### Coding Guidelines

Please follow the Coding conventions as much as possible when contributing your code. This is mostly covered by `eslint` plugin in `vscode`. Add `eslint` plugin and add below in `setting.json` in `vscode` to fix `coding style` in live editing.

```
"eslint.enable": true,
"eslint.validate": [
  "javascript",
  "javascriptreact",
  "typescript",
  "typescriptreact"
],
```

> `npm run lint` command will cover your code style either.

General styles

- The indent tab is two spaces.
- The class declaration and the `{}` in curly brackets such as function, if, foreach, for, and while should be in the following format. Also if you installed eslint in vscode or in your code editor, it will help you with linting. \* `{` should be placed in same line and `}` should be placed in next line.

```
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  ...
}
array.forEach((e) => {
  ...
});
```

- Space before `(` and after `)`.

*** Important ***
- testID should be written in `kebab-case`
  `testID = "my-test-id"`
- Class name should be a `PascalCase`
- Constants should be written in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Variables and functions should be written in `camelCase`
- Constant string variables should be written in `LOWER_SNAKE_CASE`
  `const imgUrl = 'assets/icons/icon_add.png'`

- **If you find code that does not fit in the coding convention, do not ever try to fix code that is not related to your purpose.**

#### Prettier

- [how to use prettier extension for the eslint code rules](https://medium.com/dooboolab/using-eslint-prettier-and-sort-imports-vscode-extensions-for-formatting-open-source-project-16edf317129d)
- while you are using prettier extension, you may encounter **ternary operator** indentation problems

  ![error](https://i.imgur.com/RhGrbLo.png)

  you can use

  ```
  // prettier-ignore
  ```

  like below
