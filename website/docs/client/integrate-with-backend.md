## Graphql Client

We are using [Relay](https://relay.dev) as our graphql client. Since we are only trying to use [react-hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) in our project, we're only considering using `relay-hook` either which was in [relay experimental](https://relay.dev/docs/en/experimental/a-guided-tour-of-relay) but it is now relased in `relay >= 11.+`. Please do not get confused with [relay-hooks](https://github.com/relay-tools/relay-hooks) which is a different library.
