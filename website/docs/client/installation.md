## Server installation

> Before going further steps ensure that you need to run your local `HackaTalk` server. You can do that by following procedures in [server installation](/docs/server/installation) but you can also use our `dokcer-compose.yml` file.

#### Using docker compose

1. Go to `/server` directory.
2. Run `docker compose up`.

## Client installation

Client project belongs to separate directory [client](https://github.com/dooboolab/hackatalk/tree/main/client), in [github](https://github.com/dooboolab/hackatalk).

**You need to follow [react-native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and [expo installation](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation) to continue further steps.**

1. Clone the sourcecode.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dooboolab/hackatalk.git
   ```

   > If you are willing to contribute to `HackaTalk` then please follow the [git forking workflow](https://medium.com/dooboolab/quick-start-for-contributing-to-whatssub-with-forking-workflow-16c8c971adc5) procedure.

2. Navigate to `/client`

   ```
   cd client
   ```

   - Note that `yarn.lock` and `package-lock.json` sometimes make collision. Try to delete one of them.

3. Copy the environment file.

   ```
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

   You may ignore `facebookAppId`, `googleWebClientId`, `googleAndroidClientId`, `googleIOSClientId` and `sentryAuthToken` if you are not developing related features. Otherwise, you should create your own.

4. Install packages. We recommend using [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) instead of `npm`.

   ```
   yarn
   ```

   - **Note** If you are using android emulator, you may have to change the `localhost` address to your local `ip` address. Ex) 192.0.0.6

5. Create empty `google-services.json` file.

   ```
   touch google-services.json
   ```

6. Finally run `HackaTalk` by running `yarn start`.

   ```
   yarn start
   ```

   It will open up [expo](https://expo.io) console.

7. Running in `web` environment.
   ```
   yarn web
   ```
   > Above command will let you develop with [react fast refresh](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/react-fast-refresh-the-new-react-hot-reloader-652c6645548c).
