Our developement stacks are introduced in [Contributing](https://github.com/dooboolab/hackatalk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Our development server is open for everyone in [azure websites](https://hackatalk.azurewebsites.net) and we are mainly using graphql. You can checkout our graphql resolvers in [playground](https://hackatalk.azurewebsites.net/graphql). We opened our development server to share and improve `HackaTalk` publically.
