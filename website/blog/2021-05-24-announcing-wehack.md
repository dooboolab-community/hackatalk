[WeHack](https://wehack.dev) hackathon is comming in **July 1st at 7:00 PM(KST)**.

`WeHack` is about developing [HackaTalk](http://github.com/dooboolab/hackatalk) which we've been working for a year.

We are looking forward to communicate with more great developers around Seoul and hopefully spread out globally near future.

Hope to see you in the event :blush:
